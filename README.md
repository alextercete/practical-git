# Practical Git

I've used Git for a while now, but it wasn't until five years ago that I _really_ started using it. I've written this book for people who, like me, used Git naively for too long.

I hope these pages will give you an appreciation of how powerful Git is, but also show you how to use it well. Then, it will be your _choice_ whether or not use `rebase`. (But you'll be a fool if you don't.)
