# Exercise: Undoing/redoing commits

Sometimes you'll accidentally include too many changes in one commit, and you'll wish you could go back in time to fix that mistake. Fortunately, Git allows you to achieve this! In this exercise, you'll learn how to undo/redo commits.

## Start

```
git checkout exercise/undoing-commits
```

## Restart

If you get stuck or want to restart at any point, run the following command:

```
git reset --hard origin/exercise/undoing-commits
```

## Solution

See branch [`solution/undoing-commits`][solution].
