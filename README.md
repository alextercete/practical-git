# Exercise: Amending commits

Sometimes you'll realise you forgot to add a file immediately after you commit a set of changes; or maybe you'll accidentally save the commit message before you're done writing it. Mistakes like these happen all the time, so it's useful to know how to recover from them. In this exercise, you'll learn how to amend commits.

## Start

```
git checkout exercise/amending-commits
git reset HEAD~1
```

## Restart

If you get stuck or want to restart at any point, run the following command:

```
git reset --hard origin/exercise/amending-commits
```

## Solution
